# reactive-commons-java
The purpose of reactive-commons is to provide a set of abstractions and implementations over different patterns and practices that make the foundation of a reactive microservices architecture.

Even though the main purpose is to provide such abstractions in a mostly generic way such abstractions would be of little use without a concrete implementation so we provide some implementations in a best effors maner that aim to be easy to change, personalize and extend.

The first approach to this work was to release a very simple abstractions and a corresponding implementation over asyncronous message driven communication between microservices build on top of project-reactor and spring boot.
